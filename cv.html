      <p>
        Hi there, My name is Asad and I am currently studying at City, University of London. <br> I am currently studying Computer Science.
        My future goals are to be confident at coding and fully understand the fundamentals. <br> Once I am able to confidently code, I would
        like to continue improving. After graduation,<br> I want to be able to work for a gaming or web developing company with the skills I have
        aquired from university. Since high school,<br> I always have had passion about coding so therefore I went out and tried plethora<br> of courses
        such as CS50 by Harvards. Ever since I did CS50 I have become more and more determined to achieve more within coding. <br></p>

      <p>I also love meeting knew people and interacting to improve my social skills. Currently I work for Tesco which has definetly<br>
        improved my speaking skills. I interactive to many people on a daily basis which helps me to improve.</p>
      <p>One of my favourite thing to do is travelling. I have travelled to alot of places within the UK and outside. <br> I am originally
        from Pakistan where I have created memories which will never be forgoton.</p>
